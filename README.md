# Film Buff Code Quiz

## Tasks

* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* TODO: create condition in function that when a button is clicked, the current html is hidden and a new function with the next question is called.
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* TODO: create a timer using the setInterval method that subtracts 1 second off the clock with a conditional statement that if the current question is false, 10 seconds is subtracted instead.
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* TODO: create a conditional statement in the timer function that if the timer html is === 0 || the last question is answered, hide the game and show that state page with a new function.
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and my score
* TODO: collect html inputs of initials and score using DOM and store in variables. This variable must then be stored and appended to page using setitem and getitem methods.

## Problems to be resolved
* Code is very WET
* Issues creating conditional statements and moving to next question
* Issues with For Loop
* Once these issues are resolved, feeling confident about storing data and adding to list and local storage.
